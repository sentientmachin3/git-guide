<h1>Git CLI for the impatient</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This is a guide for all users that want to learn (or are still learning)
  <code>git</code> from the command line. Despite the fact that there may be
  some errors in the following guide, I am not responsible for you destroying
  your production repository.
</p>
<p>
  Version 1 was written in LaTex, this one will not, for the following reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I am tired of writing LaTex and I do not like <code>pdflatex</code> compiler
    errors;
  </li>
  <li>everyone can open a PR if willing so;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Environment setup</h2>
<h3>Installation and configuration</h3>
<p>
  Git installation is pretty straightforward. If you are using Linux, just use
  the package manager provided by your distro,<code>pacman</code>,
  <code>apt</code> or whatever. I think, since I am not a MacOS user, it can be
  installed via <code>brew</code>. On windows, download it from the
  <a href="https://git-scm.com">site</a>.
</p>
<p>Git requires minimal configuration:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global user.name &quot;&lt;username&gt;&quot;
git config --global user.email &quot;&lt;email&gt;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
  This commands will ensure your git configuration is coeherent amongst all
  repositories, both locally and on remotes.
</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Project start and initialization</h3>
<p>
  When you first start a project, to initialize git as your versioning tool, you
  just run the command:
</p>
<pre><code>git init
</code></pre>
<p>
  This command will create a single <code>.git</code> directory, which contains
  all the basic informations git needs to track all of your changes (not really,
  but we will deep dive into it later on). Git will now work locally, since you
  did not setup a remote repo (yet).
</p>
<p>
  A <strong>remote</strong> is basically a reference of a remote server. This
  will allow to sync changes to the codebase amongst all other developers
  working on the project. The remote server will contain a copy of your local
  repo, it will be (at each <code>push</code> command) in sync with your local
  repository.
</p>
<p>
  To add a remote reference to your local repository, you need to run a command
  setting up the name and the url of the remote repo:
</p>
<pre><code>git remote add &lt;remote_name&gt; &lt;remote_url&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>remote_name</code> will be the local reference name of the remote repo
    (conventionally &quot;origin&quot;);
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>remote_url</code> is the address the remote reference points to; it
    can be an ssh address or an http(s) url, depending on the service you are
    hosting the remote on.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  You can add a <code>.gitignore</code> file in the root directory of your
  project to specify files that you do not want to version, as an example, all
  files that may contain sensitive informations, such <code>.env</code>,
  configuration files for production and so on.
</p>
<h2>Committing changes</h2>
<p>
  The core concept of git is the <strong>commit</strong>. A commit is a set of
  changes that is recorded in the commit history. Let's say you made some
  changes to the codebase. You can view these changes by running the
  <code>git status</code> command: changes are now unstaged, and are completely
  new to git.
</p>
<h3>Staging area</h3>
<p>
  Git provides a staging area, where files are added before getting committed.
  Files can be added or removed from the staging area deliberately, and
  committed at any time. In order to add some changes to the staging area, use
  the following command:
</p>
<pre><code>git add &lt;file1&gt; ... &lt;filen&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
  or automatically, skipping file names and adding the <code>-A</code> flag.
</p>
<p>
  To remove files from the staging area, use the command
  <code>git restore --staged &lt;file1&gt; ... &lt;filen&gt;</code>.
</p>
<h3>Commits</h3>
<p>
  Once you have some changes in the staging area, ready to be committed and/or
  added to production, you can to commit them.
</p>
<p>To commit changes, run the <code>git commit</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>git commit -m &quot;&lt;message&gt;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
  This command will generate a new commit on top of the current history, update
  the <code>HEAD</code> pointer (used to have a reference to the last commit)
  and use the <code>&lt;message&gt;</code> field to briefly describe the changes
  added. If you now run the <code>git status</code> command, the repository will
  show only changes you have not committed.
</p>
<p>
  Some times you may want to commit all your local changes directly, for this
  cases I use a cool shortcut: if none of the changes happened to be on a new
  file, you can commit them directly adding the <code>-a</code> flag to the
  commit command. This will automatically add all the changes to the staging
  area and commit them, without the need to adding them manually. In case you
  have any new files though, changes have to be manually added to the staging
  area (at least to my experience).
</p>
<h2>Syncing changes with remote</h2>
<p>
  Cool, now we have committed changes locally, time to push to remote. This is
  pretty simple, just run
</p>
<pre><code>git push [--force] &lt;remote_name&gt; &lt;remote_branch&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
  Changes will appear on the remote server, in the branch you are currently
  working on.
</p>
<p>
  However, pushing to a remote without catching up with its newest changes may
  result in your changes not being accepted by the remote itself. The reason is
  simple: you are pushing a new history to the remote that does not contain some
  of the changes that already exist on the remote. There is a couple of ways you
  can fix this issue:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>merge remote changes into your branch, which the safest option;</li>
  <li>force pushing your changes (with the <code>--force</code> flag).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Force pushing</h4>
<p>
  Force pushing will overwrite all remote changes with your local &quot;branch
  status&quot;. Now suppose someone made some changes and pushed them to the
  same branch you are working on. You never merged those changes locally, so you
  don'thave them at all; in this case force pushing will result in changes of
  your coworker being deleted from the branch (and it's not very pleasant, I can
  assure you).
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >Note: always specify the branch you are force pushing on, trust me.</strong
  >
</p>
<p>
  To avoid this inconveniences, the wisest option is to merge remote changes,
  always. There are a couple of cases you may want to force push though, which I
  tend to use frequently:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    you modified a local commit and want to overwrite the existing one on the
    remote;
  </li>
  <li>
    you squashed some commits together and want to update the remote history
    with the squashed version.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  A safer option to use instead of <code>--force</code> is
  <code>--force-with-lease</code> (which I strongly suggest as the default).
  This will avoid overwriting other's commits on the remote branch.
</p>
<h3>Pulling remote changes locally</h3>
<p>
  Git allows you to merge other's people work into your local repository. To
  merge a remote branch, you have to run the <code>pull</code> command:
</p>
<pre><code>git pull &lt;remote_name&gt; &lt;branch_name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
  This command will merge all the changes you do not have locally,
  &quot;automagically&quot; integrating them into your version of the repository
  and updating the current <code>HEAD</code> pointer to the top of the updated
  branch.
</p>
<h4>Merge conflicts without getting crazy</h4>
<p>
  Sometimes you and your coworker may have worked on the same files, and git may
  not be able to merge them correctly. In this case git generates what is called
  a <strong>merge conflict</strong>. A conflict occurs when you have some
  changes locally and you try to incorporate changes from another branch (which
  may or may not be on the remote).
</p>
<p>
  Git of course will not make any assumptions on how to resolve the conflicts,
  allowing the developer to take the necessary actions to fix the issue. The
  portion of code interested by the conflict will look like this:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
&lt;your code&gt;
=======
&lt;their code&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [git hash]
</code></pre>
<p>
  I agree this may look very scary (don't panic). It is indeed very simple: the
  first section marks the local code (the one your current HEAD points to); the
  bottom section contains the conflicting code pulled from the branch you are
  merging from. Note that <code>[git hash]</code> is the hash of the commit you
  are merging.
</p>
<p>You have now four choices:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Forget about your code, remove it entirely and keep the code of the branch
    you are merging from;
  </li>
  <li>
    Forget about your coworker's code, remove the bottom part and keep yours;
  </li>
  <li>
    Merge the two sections to adjust the logic of the file to make some kind of
    sense;
  </li>
  <li>
    Forget about the conflict, run <code>git merge --abort</code> and keep
    coding.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Once you have solved the issue (supposing you did), git enforces you to commit
  the changes. Personally, I like to specify which branch I was trying to merge.
</p>
