<h1>Git CLI for the impatient</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This is a guide for all users that want to learn (or are still learning)
  <code>git</code> from the command line. Despite the fact that there may be
  some errors in the following guide, I am not responsible for you destroying
  your production repository.
</p>
<p>
  Version 1 was written in LaTex, this one will not, for the following reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I am tired of writing LaTex and I do not like <code>pdflatex</code> compiler
    errors;
  </li>
  <li>everyone can open a PR if willing so;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Environment setup</h2>
<h3>Installation and configuration</h3>
<p>
  Git installation is pretty straightforward. If you are using Linux, just use
  the package manager provided by your distro,<code>pacman</code>,
  <code>apt</code> or whatever. I think, since I am not a MacOS user, it can be
  installed via <code>brew</code>. On windows, download it from the
  <a href="https://git-scm.com">site</a>.
</p>
<p>Git requires minimal configuration:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global user.name &quot;&lt;username&gt;&quot;
git config --global user.email &quot;&lt;email&gt;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
  This commands will ensure your git configuration is coeherent amongst all
  repositories, both locally and on remotes.
</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Project start and initialization</h3>
<p>
  When you first start a project, to initialize git as your versioning tool, you
  just run the command:
</p>
<pre><code>git init
</code></pre>
<p>
  This command will create a single <code>.git</code> directory, which contains
  all the basic informations git needs to track all of your changes (not really,
  but we will deep dive into it later on). Git will now work locally, since you
  did not setup a remote repo (yet).
</p>
<p>
  A <strong>remote</strong> is basically a reference of a remote server. This
  will allow to sync changes to the codebase amongst all other developers
  working on the project. The remote server will contain a copy of your local
  repo, it will be (at each <code>push</code> command) in sync with your local
  repository.
</p>
<p>
  To add a remote reference to your local repository, you need to run a command
  setting up the name and the url of the remote repo:
</p>
<pre><code>git remote add &lt;remote_name&gt; &lt;remote_url&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>remote_name</code> will be the local reference name of the remote repo
    (conventionally &quot;origin&quot;);
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>remote_url</code> is the address the remote reference points to; it
    can be an ssh address or an http(s) url, depending on the service you are
    hosting the remote on.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  You can add a <code>.gitignore</code> file in the root directory of your
  project to specify files that you do not want to version, as an example, all
  files that may contain sensitive informations, such <code>.env</code>,
  configuration files for production and so on.
</p>
<h2>Committing changes</h2>
<p>
  The core concept of git is the <strong>commit</strong>. A commit is a set of
  changes that is recorded in the commit history. Let's say you made some
  changes to the codebase. You can view these changes by running the
  <code>git status</code> command: changes are now unstaged, and are completely
  new to git.
</p>
<h3>Staging area</h3>
<p>
  Git provides a staging area, where files are added before getting committed.
  Files can be added or removed from the staging area deliberately, and
  committed at any time. In order to add some changes to the staging area, use
  the following command:
</p>
<pre><code>git add &lt;file1&gt; ... &lt;filen&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
  or automatically, skipping file names and adding the <code>-A</code> flag.
</p>
<p>
  To remove files from the staging area, use the command
  <code>git restore --staged &lt;file1&gt; ... &lt;filen&gt;</code>.
</p>
<h3>Commits</h3>
<p>
  Once you have some changes in the staging area, ready to be committed and/or
  added to production, you can to commit them.
</p>
<p>To commit changes, run the <code>git commit</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>git commit -m &quot;&lt;message&gt;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
  This command will generate a new commit on top of the current history, update
  the <code>HEAD</code> pointer (used to have a reference to the last commit)
  and use the <code>&lt;message&gt;</code> field to briefly describe the changes
  added. If you now run the <code>git status</code> command, the repository will
  show only changes you have not committed.
</p>
<p>
  Some times you may want to commit all your local changes directly, for this
  cases I use a cool shortcut: if none of the changes happened to be on a new
  file, you can commit them directly adding the <code>-a</code> flag to the
  commit command. This will automatically add all the changes to the staging
  area and commit them, without the need to adding them manually. In case you
  have any new files though, changes have to be manually added to the staging
  area (at least to my experience).
</p>
<h3>Pushing to remote</h3>
<p>
  Cool, now we have committed changes locally, time to push to remote. This is
  pretty simple, just run
</p>
<pre><code>git push &lt;remote_name&gt; &lt;remote_branch&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
  Changes will appear on the remote server, in the branch you are currently
  working on.
