# git-guide

This is a guide for people who want to quickly learn the basics of git on the cli. Hosted [here](https://dbian.dev/git-guide) as well.

PRs, issues and criticisms are welcome, insults are not. If you do not like this or my work, it is your problem.

- I met a lot of people who use it via the VS\*\*de interface but have no absolute clue of how the tool works under the hood or know very little about the non-trivial usage.
