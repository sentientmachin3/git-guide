This is a guide for people who want to quickly learn the basics of git. I met a lot of people who use it via the VS\*\*de interface but have no absolute clue of how the tool works under the hood.

PRs, issues and criticisms are welcome, insults are not. If you do not like this or my work, it is your problem.

## Why

Why not? I mean, I helped students with the university repo, why not with this.
